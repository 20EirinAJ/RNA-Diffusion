## Script version from accelerate notebook
Creating a full python script from the accelerate_notebook 

- [x]  multigpu by using accelerate 
- [x]  saving a loading models
- [x]  Allow to skip the data preparation step by using a precomputed object (Lets share the gdrive link here or upload the file)
- [ ]  add the additional mestrics (the slow kl divergence metric calculated per cell type)
- [ ]  Provide the config file to run using accelerate
- [ ]  Provide the enviroment to run the scripts (conda env)
- [ ]  Fix the weights and bias metrics (Should we use this per user or have some credentials for the project?)
- [ ]  generalize the script for more cell types
- [ ]  Work in the paralelization issues (sampling using all the GPUS instead wait for the accelerate main process finish)
